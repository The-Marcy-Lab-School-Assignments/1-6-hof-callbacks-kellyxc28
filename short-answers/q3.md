# Question
What is wrong with this code?

```js
const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
const nums = [1,2,3];
nums.forEach(printDouble());
```

# Answer
There should not be parenthesis in line 17, next to `printDouble`. It is not needed as `.forEach` is invoking the`printDouble`function. With the parenthesis, it is like invoking `printDouble` twice.
